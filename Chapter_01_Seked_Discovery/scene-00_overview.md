Prologue: Rebirth in Nara‑Ur

You awaken in a world both familiar and strange: a mist‑shrouded agrarian village called Nara‑Ur, nestled between burgeoning Egyptian and Mesopotamian realms. Last night’s nightmare—of being crushed beneath a school
bus—fades as you realize your body is that of a one‑year‑old toddler, arms pudgy and legs unsteady. At first alarmed, you soon recall the isekai tales you once loved, and thrill at this “second chance” to pursue your
buried dreams of scientific greatness.

Scene 1.1 – Dawn in the Courtyard
At five years old, you toddle beside your father into the family courtyard at sunrise. Dew‑damp earth glitters under the slanted light. A one‑meter‑tall wooden gnomon stands nearby; your ebony cubit rod—marked in 7 
palms and 28 digits—rests against the wall. Your father shows you how builders use unit‑fraction ratios (seked) to align pyramid faces without modern protractors, counting palms and fingers instead of degrees.

Scene 1.2 – Sand Sketches & Seked Trials
Kneeling in the sand, you draw right triangles: 1 cubit (7 palms) vertical rise and runs of varying lengths—first 12 digits, then 14 digits, and finally 20 digits. You note which feels closest to the slope of the
distant pyramids, expressing each run as sums of unit fractions of a cubit. Your early hypothesis—20 digits (5 palms) per cubit—brings you within striking distance of the Great Pyramid’s seked of 21 digits.

Journal Entry – Seked Trials

markdown
- Run = 12 digits → too steep  
- Run = 14 digits → still steep  
- Run = 20 digits → nearly balanced; feels like a grand staircase
   
Scene 1.3 – “Junior Seked Seeker” Reward
Your father places an ivory‑tipped palm‑rod bookmark in your hand and grants you the private title “Junior Seked Seeker.” Your siblings giggle over your muddy footprints, and your mother promises you evening dates
for this first success. The secret of your seked discovery remains inside your circle—trusted family and a handful of close friends.
