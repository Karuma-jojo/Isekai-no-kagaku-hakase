Scene 2.1 – Tracking the Gnomon’s Noon Shadow
With seked understood, you turn to timekeeping. Using time‑lapse videos and PhET/GeoGebra sundial applets, you record the gnomon’s shortest daily shadow at “true noon” over several simulated days. You log precise shadow lengths—first in decimals, then as unit fractions—and begin to see a seasonal trend.

Scene 2.2 – The Analemma & Seasonal Calendar
By observing the sun’s figure‑8 analemma in YouTube timelapses, you recognize that the noon shadow shifts both length and direction throughout the year. You sketch four pivotal shadows—equinoxes and solstices—in sand and propose placing colored pebbles at each mark. Your private Sun’s‑Eye Calendar will guide village farmers in planting and harvesting, and your father dubs you “Junior Sun‑Keeper.”
